Remote Partner - your best learning partner! 
The project, RemotePartner, is inspired by students’ need for motivation and socialization in quarantine time. The app contains five main features : 
Grouping students with the same classes: When students sign up for the app, they will be matched up with other students that take the same classes. They can chat with each other, and also form study groups together. We hope that this feature can help students find more friends and partners during this time when classes are remote. 
Forming Study Sessions : The app allows students to pick a time and form study sessions with their study groups. When a study session is formed, a reminder will be set up on the “Study Session Page”. 
Reminder for Assignment Deadlines : On the “Calendar” page, students can view their upcoming assignments. They can also use the “create new assignment” function to set up a new reminder for an upcoming assignment. Organization is the key to succeed in academics. We hope this function can help students set up their own pace during remote learning.
Sharing Notes online: One of the main concerns for remote learning is that students might not receive the most well-rounded education. Therefore, this app would allow users to access public cloud folders where students share their notes. Users can also share them from their mobile devices and Google Drive.
Logging in through google account: the app allows users to log in through their google accounts. This reduces the chance of users losing their accounts or forgetting their username/password!
Not only do we hope this app can help students succeed academically, but also have a more engaging learning experience by having more connections with peers!
